## Abstract

Many compilers, synthesizers, and theorem provers rely on rewrite
rules to simplify expressions or prove equivalences. Developing
rewrite rules can be difficult: rules may be subtly incorrect,
profitable rules are easy to miss, and rulesets must be rechecked or
extended whenever semantics are tweaked. Large rulesets can also be
challenging to apply: redundant rules slow down rule-based search and
frustrate debugging. This paper explores how equality saturation, a
promising technique that uses e-graphs to apply rewrite rules, can
also be used to infer rewrite rules. E-graphs can compactly represent
the exponentially large sets of enumerated terms and potential rewrite
rules. We show that equality saturation efficiently shrinks both sets,
leading to faster synthesis of smaller, more general rulesets.

We prototyped these strategies in a tool dubbed Ruler. Compared to a
similar tool built on CVC4, ruler synthesizes 5.8x smaller rulesets
25x faster without compromising on proving power. In an end-to-end
case study, we show ruler-synthesized rules which perform as well as
those crafted by domain experts, and addressed a longstanding issue in
a popular open source tool.
